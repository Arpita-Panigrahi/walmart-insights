#  Walmart Insights📊   

A data analysis project to uncover valuable insights about Walmart's branch-wise and category-specific performance! 🛒✨

---

## 🚀 **Overview**  

This project is an end-to-end data analysis solution designed to extract critical business insights from Walmart sales data. We utilize Python for data processing and analysis, SQL for advanced querying, and structured problem-solving techniques to solve key business questions. The project is ideal for data analysts looking to develop skills in data manipulation, SQL querying, and data pipeline creation.

The project aims to:  
- 🏆 Identify the highest-rated categories for each branch.  
- 📈 Analyze customer ratings to understand trends and performance.  
- 🔍 Provide actionable insights to improve branch efficiency and customer satisfaction.  

---

## ⚡ **Features**  

- 🌟 **Category Highlights**: Discover the best-performing categories across branches.  
- 📊 **Data Aggregation**: Compute average ratings for branches and categories.  
- 🚀 **Optimized Queries**: Leverage advanced SQL techniques for faster, cleaner results.  

---

## 🛠️ **Tools & Technologies**  

- **💻 MySQL**: The backbone for querying and managing the data.  
- **🐍 Python** (optional): For preprocessing or additional analysis.  
- **🔧 Key Concepts**:  
  - Window Functions (`RANK()`)  
  - Aggregations (`AVG`)  
  - Grouping (`GROUP BY`)  

---

## 🏃 **How to Run**  

### 1. **Set Up Database**  
   - Import your Walmart dataset into a MySQL database.  
   - Ensure the table name is `walmart` with columns like `branch`, `category`, and `rating`.  

### 2. **Run the Queries**  
   - Use a MySQL client to execute the provided queries and analyze the results.  

### 3. **Requirements**  
   - MySQL version 8.0+ (for window function support).

## 🌟 **Project Steps**  

1. **Set Up the Environment**  
   Tools Used: Visual Studio Code (VS Code), Python, SQL (MySQL)  
   Goal: Create a structured workspace within VS Code and organize project folders for smooth development and data handling.

2. **Set Up Kaggle API**  
   API Setup: Obtain your Kaggle API token from Kaggle by navigating to your profile settings and downloading the JSON file.  
   Configure Kaggle: Place the downloaded `kaggle.json` file in your local `.kaggle` folder.  
   Use the command `kaggle datasets download -d <dataset-path>` to pull datasets directly into your project.

3. **Download Walmart Sales Data**  
   Data Source: Use the Kaggle API to download the Walmart sales datasets from Kaggle.  
   Dataset Link: [Walmart Sales Dataset]  
   Storage: Save the data in the `data/` folder for easy reference and access.

4. **Install Required Libraries and Load Data**  
   Libraries: Install necessary Python libraries using:  
   `pip install pandas numpy sqlalchemy mysql-connector-python psycopg2`  
   Loading Data: Read the data into a Pandas DataFrame for initial analysis and transformations.

5. **Explore the Data**  
   Goal: Conduct an initial data exploration to understand data distribution, check column names, types, and identify potential issues.  
   Analysis: Use functions like `.info()`, `.describe()`, and `.head()` to get a quick overview of the data structure and statistics.

6. **Data Cleaning**  
   Remove Duplicates: Identify and remove duplicate entries to avoid skewed results.  
   Handle Missing Values: Drop rows or columns with missing values if they are insignificant; fill values where essential.  
   Fix Data Types: Ensure all columns have consistent data types (e.g., dates as datetime, prices as float).  
   Currency Formatting: Use `.replace()` to handle and format currency values for analysis.  
   Validation: Check for any remaining inconsistencies and verify the cleaned data.

7. **Feature Engineering**  
   Create New Columns: Calculate the Total Amount for each transaction by multiplying `unit_price` by `quantity` and adding this as a new column.  
   Enhance Dataset: Adding this calculated field will streamline further SQL analysis and aggregation tasks.

8. **Load Data into MySQL **  
   Set Up Connections: Connect to MySQL and PostgreSQL using SQLAlchemy and load the cleaned data into each database.  
   Table Creation: Set up tables in  MySQL using Python SQLAlchemy to automate table creation and data insertion.  
   Verification: Run initial SQL queries to confirm that the data has been loaded accurately.

9. **SQL Analysis: Complex Queries and Business Problem Solving**  
   Business Problem-Solving: Write and execute complex SQL queries to answer critical business questions, such as:  
   - Revenue trends across branches and categories.  
   - Identifying best-selling product categories.  
   - Sales performance by time, city, and payment method.  
   - Analyzing peak sales periods and customer buying patterns.  
   - Profit margin analysis by branch and category.

10. **Project Publishing and Documentation**  
   Documentation: Maintain well-structured documentation of the entire process in Markdown or a Jupyter Notebook.  
   Project Publishing: Publish the completed project on GitHub or any other version control platform, including:  
   - The README.md file (this document).  
   - Jupyter Notebooks (if applicable).  
   - SQL query scripts.  
   - Data files (if possible) or steps to access them.
